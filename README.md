# Use GANs to Create Art

This Jupyter Notebook explores the fascinating world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their application in creating art. GANs are a class of machine learning models that can generate data, often used in image synthesis and creative applications.

**Note:** This notebook is a part of a Cousera course - [Introduction to Deep Learning : Week 5] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-deep-learning-boulder)

In this notebook, we will:

- Provide an introduction to GANs and their architecture.
- Showcase various examples of art generated using GANs.
- Explain the code and steps involved in training a GAN for art generation.
- Offer insights into how to experiment with GANs for your own creative projects.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow (or another deep learning framework)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaitreeVaria/Use-GANs-to-create-art.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Use-GANs-to-create-art
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the "generate-art-gans.ipynb" notebook in your browser and run the cells to explore GANs for art generation.
